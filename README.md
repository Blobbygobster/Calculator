After not coding in C# for some time, I did this little project as a way to get back into coding with the C# language. 
This was following a guide found here: https://www.instructables.com/Creating-a-Calculator-Visual-Studio-C/
This is a very basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If attempting to divide by zero, the calculator will display an error.
I made this using Windows Forms so that I could create a simple GUI as well for the program.
